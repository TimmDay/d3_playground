# d3_playground

Please use index.html, index.css and index.js to see an example of the target chart.

In the html file, you can see that the script tag for the d3 library has version 3.

The goal is to get this chart working in d3-v5. Then I will get it going in react :)

PS. I have been using the VSCode golive feature to view it in the browser
The files prefixed by raw_ are data files that can be used to create the chart.
